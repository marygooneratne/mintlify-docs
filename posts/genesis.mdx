Today marks one week since the public launch of Loopscale. In that time, TVL has grown to over $40M across 6,000 weekly active users, an early sign of market demand for modular, order-book based lending.

If you’ve explored [the app](https://app.loopscale.com) since our public launch, you may have noticed the _Genesis Vaults_, the set of flagship Loopscale Vaults that quietly went live as part of our rollout. Today, we’re formally introducing the _Genesis Phase_, a four-week initiative to bootstrap liquidity and reward early users. The Genesis Phase is the first opportunity to earn designated incentives by supplying to the Genesis Vaults.

## What are Loopscale Vaults?

Historically, order book-based lending markets have faced two primary challenges: liquidity and complexity. Over-parameterization of markets can fragment supplied capital and complicate the lending experience.

Loopscale Vaults solve these challenges, enabling passive lenders to earn yield across multiple Loopscale Markets. Users can deposit to Vaults, each with a unique risk profile optimized by a Vault Curator. Curators define eligible markets and terms for the Vault.

Unlike vault products in other protocols, Loopscale Vaults are directly built on top of the core Loopscale loan primitive. This means Vaults lend into the same markets as individual lenders and capital remains composable and price-responsive.

Loopscale’s modular architecture allows us to preserve the sophistication of order book lending while making it simple and accessible through Vaults. Advanced lenders can still supply directly to the order book with custom parameters to express specific market outlooks or strategies.

## Genesis Phase

The Genesis Phase is designed to grow protocol liquidity and reward early users. Boosted incentives apply to the Genesis Vaults with initial markets for USDG, USDC, and SOL.

As the curators for the Genesis Vaults, we’ve taken a rigorous approach to risk with strict collateral inclusion criteria and conservative loan terms. Additionally, we’ve implemented a **supply cap of $40M across all Genesis Vaults**.

## What's Next?

The Genesis Phase began with our public launch and will continue for the remaining 3 weeks. Until May 8, depositors can earn boosted incentives by supplying to the Genesis Vaults on the [Loopscale app](https://app.loopscale.com).

This is the first step in a broader roadmap focused on rewarding long-term participation and scaling the Loopscale protocol. In the coming months, we’ll introduce third-party curators, launch new Vaults and strategies, and roll out additional incentive programs that deepen ecosystem alignment.

Our goal is to establish Loopscale as the programmable credit layer for Solana, enabling flexible, modular lending across a wide range of use cases.
